@title SOCS: Prolog Implementation of the "Leaving San Vincenzo" Scenario

@author Neophytos Demetriou (nkd@ucy.ac.cy)

==Summary==

This document is a step-by-step guide to writing cycle theories for intelligent
computees. It uses the "Leaving San Vincenzo" scenario to expose the basic
artifacts involved in the design of a computee as laid out in the SOCS
Deliverable D7.


==Enabling Conditions==

Enabling conditions determine when a cycle step from one transition
to another is allowed or enabled. There exist two predicates for defining
enabling conditions:

o ec/2

  Denotes general conditions for a transition to be triggered. Moreover, it
  fills the transition input with reasonable values.

o ec_user_p/2

  Denotes when a cycle step from one transition to another is allowed or 
  enabled.


==Interrupt Component==

Any of the transitions 'GI', 'RE' or 'GR' can follow after a 'PO' transition.
In addition, there exist some criteria that specify which one is more preferred
based on the nature of the 'PO' information introduced in the previous 
transition. For example, we prefer an 'RE' transition if the passive 
observations included a communication request.


==Testing==

Results are presented for all known behaviours (i.e. same scenario, different
behaviour). Some test cases include transition executions, e.g. reactivity,etc.
In that case we present several results using assumptions to demonstrate the
adaptability of the framework. For example, in test0, we present the following
results for reactivity:
