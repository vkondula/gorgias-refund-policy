- Extend the world so that the wumpus can move, i.e. dynamic world

- Extend the world so that there exist soft pits (non-static/dynamic world), 
  i.e. the agent falls in, only if s/he holds the gold. Add action 
  ''release'' -- this way the agent may release the gold to check whether 
  the breeze comes from a regular pit or not.

- Let the user input sensing observations (more convincing this way). 
  For example, the agent will ask
  for the value of fluents in a location and the user will enter whether there
  is stench,breeze,glitter,etc.

- Use abducibles for possible pit/wumpus location, e.g ass(at(wumpus,location(X,Y))). 
  These assumptions are defeated by concrete rules on abducible predicates that
  assert known facts. For example, consider wumpus world 4. Suppose that our agent
  *knows* that there is stench at location (3,1). Now, the assumption 
  ass(at(wumpus,location(2,3))) is defeated by the asserted fact that at(stench,location(3,1)).

- Display agent's perception of the environment and the actual environment.
