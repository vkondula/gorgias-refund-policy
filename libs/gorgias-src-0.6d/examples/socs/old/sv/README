==London, July 28, 2003 - August 4, 2003==

Computees:

* Francisco's

* Taxi

* Hotel







==Example 1: Checkout Process Failure==

* Francisco realizes that his personal computee has initiated the checkout
  process (GI, PI, AE, AE).

  - GI = "checkoutFromHotel"

  - PI = "checkoutFromHotel" 

         >> [electronicPayment, callTaxi]

  - AE = "electronicPayment"

  - Postconditions: 

    o electronicPayment => receipt (before Francisco enters the taxi)


* At this point the taxi computee informs Francisco's computee that the taxi
  is outside the hotel's entrance (PO)

_____


* Features: 

  o Careful vs non-careful behaviour: 

	When the user is ready to leave the hotel, he is notified that the 
	electronic payment failed. (PR)

  o Punctual vs non-punctual behaviour: 

	Discussion: [GI, PI, AE, AE, PO] vs [GI, PI, GI, PI, GI, PI, AE, ...]

  o Cautious vs non-cautious behaviour: 

______







==TODO==

* Ask IC to provide more information about the nature of the Temporal 
  Constraints.

* Ask City University to provide ancestor methods for the computee's goals and plans.

* Use Sicstus object-oriented features for the behaviour types.

* REFINEMENT transition. Have toplevel goals. If planning a toplevel goal fails, then try to refine the toplevel goal to subgoals and then
