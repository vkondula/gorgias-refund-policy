Gorgias -- An Extensible Argumentation Framework with Abduction.
================================================================


This README is very sparse, look for more details at http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~nkd/gorgias/ if this is insufficient.


INSTALLATION

1. An SWI-Prolog installation is needed as a requirement for Gorgias. 

2. First, untar or move this folder into the final installation location.

3. You're done! Check out the examples that come bundled with the distribution.


USAGE

1. Create a file to hold the domain description.

2. Add the following lines in the top of the file:

	:- compile('/path/to/gorgias/lib/gorgias.pl').
	:- compile('/path/to/gorgias/ext/lpwnf.pl').


3. Write your domain description in the file and load it into a prolog shell. In SWI-Prolog, you can do that with

	pl -s yourfilename.pl
