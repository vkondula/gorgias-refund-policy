TODO

- GUI

- Catch infinite loops (provided that all rule labels are ground)

- Provide a tr/1 predicate that evaluates its "input" using temporal reasoning
  (similar to g_check/1).

- Use incompatible/2 rather than complement/2 so that it can reflect their
  properties, i.e. two complementary predicates are incompatible but not vice
  versa.
